## Development Environment

You are welcome to use the computers in the Digital Lab (EB 423) to work on your labs, however, none of the labs require you to sit at one of these computers since the code you write will be on your Raspberry Pi Zero. The labs will be tested and graded on a Raspberry Pi (with a Linux operating system), so you need to make sure that it works in that environment. All grading will be done using pure Linux. If you don't have access to Linux on your machine, you can SSH into a Embedded Lab computer and develop from there, or install a VM on your machine. 

To SSH into an Embedded Lab computer, use the following host name: `embed-<N>.ee.byu.edu`, replacing <N> with the computer number. These computers should have all the necessary libraries and executables to do the labs.

## Visual Studio Code

In this lab we will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It's a good enough and has a lot of powerful extensions. Specifically, using the auto-formatting on save will save you a lot of trouble (and points) when you submit your code. Set up your VS Code [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) with the following Clang format specification:

```
{ BasedOnStyle: LLVM, UseTab: Never, IndentWidth: 4, TabWidth: 4, ColumnLimit: 100 }
```

(you can also change the ColumnLimit to 80, the default.)

Here is an example of my configuration:


I even have it format my code on save.


If you are working on the labs remotely (SSHing into a computer), I *strongly* recommend you figure out how to use [VS Code's remote development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh). It is a very powerful way of developing on a remote machine while making it look like everything is local. Spending some time now will save you a lot of time later... I promise.

## Terminal

A theme in this class will be setting up your environment so that it matches your preferences, making your life easier. This is true with your terminal app—set it up so that it brings you joy (as much as a terminal app can) and works with your habits. 

My highly opinionated set up involves using [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), and [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). If you would like read more about my setup, you can go [here](https://byunetlab.notion.site/Phil-s-Computer-Setup-0722e33e22e74460aa53f58d5f2babb8).

## Git Repositories

For the labs, we will be using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms). If you are unfamiliar with Git, now is the time to start learning. VSCode has some Git integrations which will make this easier. 

For each lab, you will be given a link to start the lab. This will automatically create a GitHub repo for you for that lab. The first three labs have template code for you. This is the only way to start and submit the lab! In order for your code to be graded, you must push your code to your repo.

## Lab Submission

To submit your lab, you must create a tag named `final` on your git repository. The following command will tag your most recent commit and push that tag to GitHub:

```
git tag final
git push origin final
```

This tag will point to your most recent commit of whichever branch you are currently located on (so make sure all of your changes are committed before running this). If you are not confident you did this correctly, you may want to go to a new directory (not in your repo) and run `git clone --branch final <repo_url>` to clone your tag and verify that it builds and runs correctly.

If, after you create this tag, you want to change it (i.e., re-submit your code), you can run the following commands and include the --force option to overwrite the tag:

```
git tag --force final
git push --force origin final
```

If you don’t use the correct tag name (`final`), the lab will not be count as submitted.
