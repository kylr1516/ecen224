        <h1>ECEn 224: Introduction to Computer Systems</h1>
        <p class="info">MWF, 9–9:50 AM<br>
            T, 12–12:50 PM (recitation)<br>
            Th, 12–2:50 PM (lab)<br>
            4 credits<br>
            Class is listed as ECEn 493R section 2</p>


        <p>I, Dr. Lundrigan, am piloting a new class sophomore-level class, ECEn
            224, and I need your help! I need motivated students interested
            in shaping the sophomore student experience for years to come. The class
            will be taught full-time starting next year (Fall 2023). In the
            meantime, I would like to get a feel for how students enjoy the content,
            labs, class pacing, etc. I am looking for about 20 interested sophomore
            students to help pilot this class. If you are interested, contact me at
            lundrigan@byu.edu.</p>

        The class will cover the following topics:
        <ul>
            <li><b>C Programming</b>. After taking this class, you will be an advanced C programmer.</li>
            <li><b>Machine Representation</b>. You will learn how a computer translates a C program into a machine code
            </li>
            <li><b>Computer Organization</b>. Learn how computers are structured to be efficient and flexible.</li>
            <li><b>Complex System</b>. The semester project is to build a smart doorbell system. You will gain
                experience with connecting multiple systems to build something really cool.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This class will also have a practical skills component where we will teach you how to use Linux command line
            and tools like git, gdb, make, etc.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>What credit do I get for taking this class?</h3>
        <p>If you are a Computer Engineering student, you will get credit for ECEn 424. You still must take ECEn 220.</p>
        <p>If you are an Electrical Engineering student, this class will replace ECEn 220. If you have already taken ECEn 220, then this class will count as credit for ECEn 323.</p>
        <p>If you are an IT&C student, you get credit for IT&C 252.</p>

        <h3>Why would I mess up my schedule to take this class?</h3>

        <p>Here are a few reasons to go through the trouble of moving your schedule around so you can take this class.
            First, you get to do something that not very many students have the opportunity to do—directly impacting a
            class's content for years to come. Since this is a pilot, I will take all student feedback very seriously.
            You will be a partner with me in building this class together.</p>

        <p>Second, you will have an advantage over your peers. This content is so crucial that we are moving it to the
            sophomore year, starting next year (as opposed to an optional senior-level class). You will have the
            opportunity to learn material your peers won't learn. As a result, you will be more competitive for
            internships and other opportunities.</p>

        <p>Lastly, as part of this class, a practical skills component will teach you essential skills like Linux
            command line, git, gdb, etc. This material is not taught anywhere else in our program. You get credit for
            learning these skills, and your peers have to learn them on their own.</p>

        <h3>Why is this class 4 credits?</h3>

        <p>Since this course has a three-hour lab, plus a regular lecture schedule, we felt that 4 credits would be a
            better representation of how much work a student will do for this class.</p>

        <h3>What is the time slot on Tuesday?</h3>

        <p>The Tuesday timeslot is an optional recitation session where you will meet with a TA to discuss the course
            content, practice example problems, and learn important skills that will help you in the labs. While it is
            not required, I highly recommend it.</p>

        <h3>What are the prerequisites for this class?</h3>
        <p>CS 111 (or CS 142)</p>

        <h3>What will I learn about in this class?</h3>
        Here are the learning objectives
        <ul>
            <li><b>Binary Representation and Computation</b>. Ability to represent numbers in binary and perform binary
                operations.</li>
            <li><b>C Programming</b>. Ability to program using the C programming language.</li>
            <li><b>Machine Representation of Programs</b>. Ability to represent programs in assembly language, translate
                between C and assembly language, and evaluate security vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><b>Computer Organization</b>. Ability to identify basic computer components, including memory hierarchy,
                I/O, and central processing unit (CPU), and explain how these components work together to create a
                computer system.</li>
            <li><b>I/O Programming</b>. Ability to build a system that securely interacts with I/O devices and computer
                networks through C programming.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Is there a book?</h3>
        <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X">Computer
                Systems: A Programmer's Perspective 3E</a>.</p>

        <h3>How do I join the class?</h3>
        <p>The class is add-code only, so you will need to email me (lundrigan@byu.edu) to join the class.</p>

        <h3>Why is the class listed as ECEn 493R?</h3>
        <p>Since this is a pilot class, it gets a temporary course number, 493R. Next year, it will have its normal
            number, 224.</p>
